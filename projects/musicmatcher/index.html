          Music Matcher was born in early 2023 as a last minute idea for a
          school project, the first version was an offline quiz app that
          generated an exportable playlist merging the survey's answers and
          using Spotify API.
          <br /><br />
          In late 2023 and early 2024, the project was brought back to life and
          enriched with a lot of new market research and interviews to enhance
          the user experience, the new app includes a lobby system so tha
          multiple persons can answer questions about their musical mood at the
          same time.

          Albyeah and myself also developed fresh new visual identity that would
          match with the purpose of the app. The new mood embraces a
          neo-brutalist core and makes the experience more playful and less
          boring.
          <br /><br />
          One cool new feature is in the last step of the survey, which
          implements a dating-app-like swiping mechanism that helps the
          algorithm to better understand what kind of tracks we are trying to
          find in the playlist
