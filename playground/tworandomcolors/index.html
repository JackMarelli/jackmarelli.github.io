        Color is defined as the aspect of things that is caused by differing
        qualities of light being reflected or emitted by them. To see color, you
        have to have light. When light shines on an object some colors bounce
        off the object and others are absorbed by it. Our eyes only see the
        colors that are bounced off or reflected. The first person to discover
        the link between color and light was scientist Sir Isaac Newton. When
        working with color, particularly in design and print, we distinguish two
        methods: additive and subtractive. On a monitor, display or television
        screen, colors consist of red, green and blue (RGB). But when it comes
        to printed media, prints or paint for objects or dyes, cyan, magenta and
        yellow (CMY) form the basis to compose colors. We call working with RGB
        the additive use and working with CMY the subtractive use of color.
